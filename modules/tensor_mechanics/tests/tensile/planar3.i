# checking for small deformation
# A single element is stretched by 1E-6m in the z and x directions, with lame mu = 1E6, so trial stress is 2Pa in those directions
# tensile_strength is set to 1Pa
# Then the final stress should return to the z and x stresses being 1.0 (up to tolerance), and internal parameter = (0.5+0.5)E-6 = 1.0E-6
# Using 'planar' Tensile plasticity
